Welcome to my final project!

In essence, I wanted to create a web application that functions similarly to populat chat services such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord. 

Simply log in and follow the new group link to start a chatroom. Invite your specified users (in this case, you may need to create multiple accounts) and give the group a name. You may then click on the group's name on the left side of your screen to begin chatting.
